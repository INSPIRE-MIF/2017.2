about: This issue documents an example implementation of an alternative encoding

---

**Implementation Example**

Use the sections below to document your implementation example.

## Name of the data set

Name or tile of the data set that has been encoded.

## Encoding rule

Specify which encoding rule has been used, e.g. 

* AD GeoJSON encoding
* EF GeoJSON encoding 

## Source data

Provide a description and a link to the Source data that was used.

Please explain whether, given the characteristics of your source data, you consider the GeoJSON encoding
to be an additional or alternative encoding.

## Encoded data & encoding process / tools

Provide a link to the encoded data and describe the process and tools (incl. versions) that you used to encode the data
or for testing the encoded data (e.g. client tools or libraries).

## Issues encountered

Describe any issues that you encountered during the transformation/encoding process.

Propose (where appropriate) changes or improvements to the specification.

## Future plans

Are you considerin to use the GeoJSON encodings as alternative/additional encodings for your data? Please explain why (not)?

Would you like to see further alternative/additional encodings to be developed? If so, for which themes and based on which
base standard (GeoJSON, Geopackage, GML, ...)?
