**GeoJSON example**

# Short description
Give a short description of the existing GeoJSON encoding, including e.g. 
the thematic domain (where relevant, the covered INSPIRE theme(s)).

# Example instance
Provide a link to an example instance of the described GeoJSON encoding or attach an example file.

# Underlying (INSPIRE) conceptual model
If the encoding is implementing a conceptual model (e.g. from INSPIRE), please provide
details and/or a reference to the conceptual model (e.g. the relevant INSPIRE application
schema) here.

# Purpose & use
Explain the purpose(s) or use case(s) for which this encoding has been developed.
You can also include here a description on how the encoding is already used 
in practice.

# Used simplification rules
If any simplification rules (e.g. flattening of complex structures or custom data type
mappings) have been used to create this encoding from the originating conceptual
model, please describe them here.

# Additional information
This is an optional section for additional information, e.g. on known limitations or
issues.
