**bijective data transformation**

bijective transformation where the two sets are data structures, consisting of data elements

NOTE 1 A transformed data structure can be transformed back again into the original data structure if the applied data transformation is bijective.

**bijective model transformation**

bijective transformation where the two sets are models, consisting of model elements

NOTE 1 The first data model is also called the source model and the second data model is also called the target model.

NOTE 2 A transformed model can be transformed back again into the original model if the applied model transformation is bijective.

**bijective transformation**<br />
bijective function<br />
bijection

function between the elements of two sets where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set.

NOTE As a consequence, there are no unpaired elements in the two sets.

**code**

representation of a label according to a specified scheme

[ISO 19118:2011]

**conversion rule**

rule for converting instances in the input data structure to instances in the output data structure

[ISO 19118:2011]

**data**

reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing

[ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993]

**encoding process**<br />
encoding

conversion of data into a series of codes

[ISO 19118:2011]

**encoding rule**<br />
encoding

identifiable collection of conversion rules that define the encoding for a particular data structure

NOTE The term encoding is used as a synonym for both encoding rule and encoding process and should therefore not be used in the alternative encoding specifications.

[ISO 19118:2011]

**information**

Knowledge concerning objects, such as facts, events, things, processes, or ideas, including concepts, that within a certain context has a particular meaning

[ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993]

**INSPIRE additional encoding rule**<br />
additional encoding rule<br />
additional encoding

encoding rule that is not the INSPIRE default encoding rule and does not have to meet all requirements from the Implementing Rule on interoperability of spatial data sets and services

NOTE Not all elements from the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model might be encoded.

**INSPIRE alternative encoding rule**<br />
alternative encoding rule<br />
alternative encoding

encoding rule that is not the INSPIRE default encoding rule and meets all requirements from the INSPIRE Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services

**INSPIRE default encoding rule**<br />
default encoding rule<br />
default encoding

encoding rule that is specified in [D2.7, Annex B (normative) Default encoding rule]

NOTE The INSPIRE default encoding rule is the encoding rule specified in ISO 19136 Annex E with the extensions in GML 3.3 together with the additional rules stated in [D2.7, Annex B].

**partial transformation**<br />
partial function

Most transformations between the elements of two sets do not pair each element of one set with exactly one element of the other set. They are thus regarded partial transformations, even if they can be reversed.

NOTE As a consequence, there are no unpaired elements in the two sets.

**Property name**<br />
field name<br />
attribute name

The name of a column or property, as defined through a feature type or table schema.
