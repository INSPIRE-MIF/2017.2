# Glossary for Alternate and Alternative Encodings

## Alternate Encoding

An Alternate Encoding may be used to encode an INSPIRE data set instead of using the Default Encoding, since, for that data set, all requirements of the Implementing Rule can be met using the Alternate Encoding.

## Additional Encoding

An Additional Encoding may be used to encode an INSPIRE data set in addition to the Default Encoding. The Additional Encoding does not have to satisfy all requirements of the Implementing Rule for that data set.

## Bijective Transformation

In mathematics, a bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is  paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In terms of a transformation, this means that for every source model element, there is a corresponding element in the target model, and the transformation can first be executed in the direction `A > B` and then back `B > A'`, with `A` equal to `A'`

## Bijective Model Transformation

A Bijective Model Transformation is a model transformation where each model element in the source and target model is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is  paired with exactly one element of the first set. This means if the model transformation between an original model and the transsformed model is lossless, and the original model can be fully recreated based on the transformed model.

## Bijective Data Transformation

This means if the data transformation between the default encoding and the alternate encoding is bijective, that conversion is lossless, and the original data set using the default encoding can be fully recreated based on the data that was transformed to the Alternate Encoding before.
