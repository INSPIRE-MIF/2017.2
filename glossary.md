# Glossary for Alternative Encodings

## INSPIRE Alternative Encoding Rule

alternative encoding rule
alternative encoding

An encoding rule that is not the INSPIRE default encoding rule and meets all requirements from the INSPIRE Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services.

## INSPIRE Additional Encoding Rule 

additional encoding rule
additional encoding

An encoding rule that is not the INSPIRE default encoding rule and does not have to meet all requirements from the Implementing Rule on interoperability of spatial data sets and services.

NOTE Not all elements from the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model might be encoded.

## Bijective Transformation

In mathematics, a bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is  paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In terms of a transformation, this means that for every source model element, there is a corresponding element in the target model, and the transformation can first be executed in the direction `A > B` and then back `B > A'`, with `A` equal to `A'`.

## Bijective Model Transformation

A Bijective Model Transformation is a model transformation where each model element in the source and target model is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is  paired with exactly one element of the first set. This means if the model transformation between an original model and the transsformed model is lossless, and the original model can be fully recreated based on the transformed model.

## Bijective Data Transformation

This means if the data transformation between the default encoding and the alternative encoding is bijective, that conversion is lossless, and the original data set using the default encoding can be fully recreated based on the data that was transformed to the Alternative Encoding before.

## Code

Representation of a label according to a specified scheme
[ISO 19118:2011]

## Conversion rule

Rule for converting instances in the input data structure to instances in the output data structure
[ISO 19118:2011]

## Data

Reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing
[ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993]

## INSPIRE default encoding rule

default encoding rule
default encoding

encoding rule that is specified in [D2.7, Annex B (normative) Default encoding rule]

NOTE The INSPIRE default encoding rule is the encoding rule specified in ISO 19136 Annex E with the extensions in GML 3.3 together with the additional rules stated in [D2.7, Annex B].

## Encoding process

Encoding

Conversion of data into a series of codes
[ISO 19118:2011]

## Encoding rule

Identifiable collection of conversion rules that define the encoding for a particular data structure
[ISO 19118:2011]

NOTE The term `Encoding` is used as a synonym for both Encoding Rule and Encoding Process and should therefore not be used in the alternative encoding specifications.

## Information

Knowledge concerning objects, such as facts, events, things, processes, or ideas, including concepts, that within a certain context has a particular meaning
[SOURCE: ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993]

## Format

Language construct that specifies the representation, in character form, of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device, or transmission channel
[ISO 19145:2013; ISO/IEC 2382â€‘15:1999]
